<!-- 
    [X] Create a <main> element in your index.html file. Make sure the element has a class of container.
    [X] Create a scripts/catalog.js module.
    [X] Define and export a Catalog function.
    [X] The Catalog function should accept the harvested food array as input.
    [ ] The Catalog function should iterate the array of food objects.
    [ ] As you iterate the array, the <main> element should have its inner HTML appended with an HTML representation of a food item.
        Use the following example for each food item.
        The example has Corn hard-coded. Yours should not.
        It should output the name property of the current food object.

    <section class="plant">Corn</section>
